# Packrat

Packrat is a standalone asset packaging library for games and interactive tools.

Initial focus:

- Image asset packing
- Single-image sprites
- Sprite-sheet frame extraction
- Data-driven animation clip definitions

Longer-term direction:

- Expand to additional asset domains (audio, fonts, data blobs, etc.)
- Remain portable and easy to embed in engine/tool pipelines
